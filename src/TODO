* when the "in" is processed, it is cached. we do this because each function should only be run 1 time per change
* when the element no longer matches, it is not removed from the processed cache, meaning if the element ever changes *back* to a matching status, its function is not run again.

* we need to track "out" elements as they come in, so that we know when an attribute has changed and they no longer match
